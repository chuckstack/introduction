# The Value of Actions in Workflow
The purpose of this post is to discuss the value of adding actions to a given workflow process. You are not required to define actions. You can simple define transitions and let the user change the state manually as is needed. 

This begs the question
> what is the value of actions?

Here is a quick list for your reference:
- Actions allow you to simplify the workflow user experience by defining a "go do it..." option.
- Actions allow you do define who can do what. This is helpful when you need to add additional user or role restrictions.
- Actions (and thereby Action Types) allow you to execute previously define logic/automation when executing a transition.
