# Incus Virtualization

## Summary
[Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/) is a container and virtual machine (VM) manager.

Why we like Incus:
- It starts simple and scales to enterprise levels.
- It is functionally complete, and the codebase has been in production for 10+ years.
- It can be used for both desktop virtualization as well as server/cluster virtualization.
- It is REST and command line interface (CLI) focused.
- It is well documented.
- It is a pure open source project.
- It is a strong community support in both open forums and from paid/sponsored personnel.
