# transaction-academy Testimonials

What makes us great at transaction-academy? Hear it from those who know best!

Steve - CEO

> Our core business revolves around bringing the power of ERP to end users in low-resource settings. Chuck and the academy has been invaluable in helping us quickly and cost-effectively get a working understanding of ERP that is tailored to our current needs, both through the well-organized academy and through their individual team-teaching sessions. They have an unusual ability to distill down the breadth of knowledge and give us focused learning on just what we need to know.

Joseph - Business Owner

> Engaging Chuck was the single most important decision we made. Their ERP tutorials helped demystify ERP and provided valuable knowledge on many different operational aspects (accounting, material management, procurement, IT etc..). Their knowledge of ERP is second to none and their enthusiasm to share it is quite refreshing.

Jeremy - CEO/CTO

> I find Chuck to be extremely polite, enthusiastic, accommodating and friendly, with a genuine desire to help people. When coupled with the breadth and depth of their knowledge of all aspects of ERP – all the way from high-level accounting practices to low-level database optimization and systems administration – it makes for an experience which is as informative as it is enjoyable.

Nasi - Business Owner

> I have yet to hear Chuck say something cannot be done. This sums up their approach to ERP. Combine their knowledge and their teaching platform that LAD provides and you have a sure way to a successful ERP implementation.

> Our businesses are much smaller than most that would implement an ERP, but LAD is as passionate as we are as we go through this process. LAD provides a large safety net when trying to deploy the ins and outs of ERP.

Stefanie - Administrative Services Manager

As someone who has no background in ERP and is not very tech savvy, I was a little overwhelmed when I was first tasked with implementing an ERP for our company, but Chuck has been a great resource to help me to get this project moving in the right direction. LAD training is a great resource to help you understand the different areas of ERP and how the system can be used to fit your company's needs. The videos are clear and extremely helpful in each topic presented and LAD is extremely knowledgeable in so many different areas of ERP. I find the live open discussions extremely valuable as it provides an opportunity to discuss our questions or issues with fellow members and allows us to work through real life scenarios in real time. LAD is always willing to help you work through an issue or question and is extremely patient if you are struggling to grasp a concept.

Brian - Business Owner

The great thing about Chuck is that I have learned a tremendous amount about not only ERP, but business operations and accounting too. I realize now more than ever that having a "system" is the only way to work ON your business instead of IN it. And I, of course, could not have done any of it without the help of Chuck and the academy.

Rumman - Business Owner

Thank you so much for all your assistance and the wonderful way in which you led me to implement ERP in my organization. Not only did I learn about ERP's from you, I am also an admirer of the way you teach with passion and dedication. The learning on that front has been amazing too.

Jacob - Business Systems Analyst

I’ve recently signed up for your training, and I just want to let you know that it has been an amazing experience so far. It was a nice change of pace to find such a well-structured, well-articulated training program such as yours. Thank you, and keep up the great work!

Christiono - ERP Integrator

Chuck has helped in many of our projects in ERP. Every time we hit a dead end, he's always ready with a great idea to keep our project on track.

LAD is honest, optimistic and enthusiastic in helping us solve our training problems. Their ways of teaching inspire us to explore ERP even more, which lead us to many more questions and build more interactions within the company.

Thank you for being our mentor.

Mike - ERP Integrator

Thank you for the service you provide to ERP community as a whole. I appreciate your educational style and take on ERP. I had no idea of the depth of detail to which you go. We were impressed by your coverage.

Gaurav - ERP Administrator

Chuck is well versed with the technical as well as functional knowledge of ERP. The best thing about LAD is that you are always there to help even for the basic query. Apart from ERP, your wide range of knowledge & style of explaining things easily makes you unique.

Michael – General Manager Business Processes and Systems

Training for an ERP system is difficult and Chuck made it so much easier and less time-consuming for us. Thanks and keep up the great work!

Kevin - CIO

I've been Chuck for some time now and can't stress enough how invaluable it has been to me and our organization. LAD's immense knowledge in many different realms provides a unique approach to ERP implementation and management. Add to that LAD's passion for educating and you've got a very unique package.

Hans - ERP Manager

Chuck has ability to explain the complex environment of an ERP system. Not only do they focus focus on technical aspects like database, java programming language or application server topics. Based on live discussion with students from all regions in the world, LAD clarifies all the business relevant tasks and their relations. They have an absolutely strong background in accounting topics, which is the heart of every ERP system.

Kiera Campbell-Gillies - Web Manager

Einstein said, “I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.” I believe this is one of LAD's greatest strengths.

You have an amazing ability to place someone into an environment, provide us with what we need to learn and coach us through, until we're ready to go solo. But you have another inherent ability that really makes this work. You have a perfect sense of timing.

You know exactly when to let go and how much to let go, and you do it seamlessly. You know how to draw out the natural ability in people and show them how to polish and enhance that ability.

Tim Gray - CEO

In my opinion, the thing that makes Chuck unique, memorable and fun is the combination of your optimism and enthusiasm when taking on hard/challenging tasks. We appreciate your interest in learning/growing. Most importantly, we appreciate your sincerity!
